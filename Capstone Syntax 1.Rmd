To see how R is operating Do sensitivity analysis on these two glm functions by taking a small chunk of data (first 100 observations - for learnign purposes to confirm R glm function eliminated NA values); 

#Keep UNKOWN VARIABLES; treat unknown as another category in the analysis.Can subset to all completed observations for death and medcond variables with filter verb by the missing values.

A correlated relationship seems to exist between "yes" for hospital admittance and "yes" for ICU admission. I am opting to use hospital admittance rather than ICU admission.

Table 1 shows the demographic and health status breakdown of the voluntarily reported COVID-19 infected individuals as of February 2021. A total of 17,007,859 individual-level laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 positive observations were included in the analysis, with 85.1% of individuals having ages between 20 years and over 80 years; the distribution between Females and Males within this age bracket was even with approximately 85.5% of Females and 84.8% of Males between the ages of 20 years and 80+ years. The most common race/ethnicity presented in the data were "Whites" with approximately 31.3% Females, 30.4% Males, and 30.7% of all individual observations. Hispanic/Latino" was the second most common reported race/ethnicity with approximately 11.1% Female and 11.3% Male, comprising 11.1% of overall observations; "Blacks, Non-Hispanic" was the third most common race/ethnicity comprising of approximately 7% of all individuals. Although 78.3% of the data regarding the presence of underlying comorbidities/conditions was missing, there was even distribution of the presence or lack of comorbidities between Females and Males with approximately 6.1% of Females and 6.0% of Males presenting with no comorbidities, and 6.5% of females and 6.0% of males having comorbidities or underlying illnesses.
Lastly, although death status is missing 39.1% of all observations, approximately 49% of COVID-19 infected individuals survive their illness whereas 1.7% of COVID-19 infected individuals died of the disease. 

Shown below are the results of the first of two binomial multivariate logistic regressions. Surveillance data was collected on the laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 positive individuals within the United States between the ages of 0 and 80+ years and grouped into the age cohorts "0-9", "10-19", and "20-80+" in order to distinguish between children, adolescents/young adults, and adults. The first model denotes the association between the death status outcome, the presence of underlying comorbidities, and the individual's age by age group, adjusting for both race/ethnicity and sex. The results of this analysis show that both children ages 0-9 years and adolescents/young adults aged 10-19 years have a log odds of death from COVID-19 illness of -0.762 and -0.511, respectively. This association for both age groups is statistically significant with p-values <2e-16; Thus indicating that, when compared to adults aged 20-80+ years, both children and adolescents/young adults have a lesser likelihood of dying from COVID-19 - this is consistent with the findings in current literature.   
The presence of underlying conditions/comorbidities was also shown to be statically significant, p-value = <2e-16. Therefore, the log odds of death for an individual with a comorbidity or underlying illness is 1.85 times more likely than an individual without a comorbidity.

The second multivariate logistic model tests the associations between death, sex, race/ethnicity, and the presence of comorbidities for laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 positive children and adolescents/young adults, adjusting for age group. As shown in the results, despite the higher prevalence of Males contracting COVID-19, the log odds of Males dying from COVID-19 is -0.01473, p-value = 0.2904; thus, indicating no statistically significant difference in the likelihood of death from COVID-19 between Males and Females. When contrasted to individuals identified as "White", both non-Hispanic Blacks and non-Hispanic Asians were less likely to die of COVID-19 with statistically significant, p-value = <2e-16, log odds of -0.46321 and -0.34397, respectively. Hispanic/Latinos and non-Hispanic individuals of Multiple Race/Ethnicities showed a statiscally significant increased likelihood of death form COVID-19 with log odds 0.23903 and 0.64074, respectively. Non-Hispanic Asian Pacific Islander/Native Hawaiians and American Indian/Alaska Natives did not show statistically significant difference in their log odds when compared to Whites. Lastly, the presence of comorbidities resulted in a statistically significant log odds of 0.95070, indicating that, similarly to the first model, the presence of comorbidities in COVID-19 individuals results in an increased likelihood of dying from COVID-19 as compared to their counterparts without underlying conditions.
